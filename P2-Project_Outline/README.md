## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application will help sales associates in the heath care technology field identify their top prospects. This will specifically be related to the population heath technology market. Sales associates will be able to login to a dashboard that shows the top prospects in their region along with graphs and other visualizations of their target list. The type of prospects will be hospitals and health systems that are participating in an accountable care organization or have other public data to indicate a potential shift to value-based care models. I will be manipulating and analyzing data to determine what factors may contribute to prioritizing or predicting the prospects that are most likely to purchase population health technology.

Users will find this useful because it will help them prioritize prospects, leading to less "wasted" time and greater results against their sales quotas. This idea came from related requests I get at work as a data analyst. I would like to perform this type of analysis quicker and on larger datasets by leveraging the kinds of capabilities programming provides. I would also like the ability to present my findings into an easy-to-consume format.
